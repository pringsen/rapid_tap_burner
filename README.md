# Rapid Burner v8 - Simplified version
##Mission
This toolhead is a simplified version of the amazing [Rapid Burner Toolhead](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/edit/main/V0/Rapid_Burner) by [chirpy2605](https://github.com/chirpy2605).

While i love the design of the original version of this toolhead i wanted to achieve a **simpler design** for **improved maintainability** and a **simpler construction** for it to work specifically with the following hardware:
* [Rapido UHF V1](https://www.phaetus.com/products/rapido-hotend)
* [Chaoticlab TAP V1](https://chaoticlab.xyz/products/cnc-voron-tap)
* [Orbiter V2.0](https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/)

The design reduced the overall parts from 4 to two main parts: A base plate and hotend/extruder assembly and the cover with all the fans. As a nice addon the airflow has been improved and also the weight has been slightly reduced. The LED mouts have not been changed. Designs can be downloaded from the original repository by chripy.
